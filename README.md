## Specification implementation

The specification may be implemented by website by placing file on domain root path, e.g. `example.com/learnme.json`.

The specification is used for planning and tracking education in [learntray.com](https://learntray.com), so by setting

```js
{
  ...
  "agreement": {
    ...
    "individuals": ["learntray.com"]
  }
}
```

the content described by learnme file may be indexed and used by LearnTray website and then users may include that content in their learning plans. To learn more check out [learntray documentation](https://learntray.com/docs).

Due to the security reasons, only HTTPS connection is recommended, not HTTP.

## Specification development

The specification is founded and maintained by [@orzechdev](https://github.com/orzechdev). In case of needed contact please reach founder directly or create an issue in this repository.
